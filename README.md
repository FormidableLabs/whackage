  Multi-repo development tooling for React Native
</h4>

***

### What is this?

**`whackage` provides a hot-reload-friendly workflow for developing across multiple React Native packages**

React Native packager, the development server that bundles your app's JavaScript sources, has a few rough
edges when it comes to developing apps and libraries that span across multiple repositories. It doesn't
[handle symlinks](https://productpains.com/post/react-native/symlink-support-for-packager) reliably, and the
[Haste module system](https://github.com/facebookarchive/node-haste/tree/master) gets easily confused by
`@providesModule` declarations in subdependencies.

Whackage is an `npm link` replacement that works with React Native. It synchronizes changes in your local workspace to your project's `node_modules` without using symlinks, and automatically generates a packager blacklist for linked modules to avoid Haste naming collisions.

We wrote whackage to scratch our own itch when working on [Victory Native](https://github.com/formidablelabs/victory-native). It's a blunt instrument, but it works well. Hope you find it useful!

### How-to

#### Quick start

```sh
# install whackage globally
npm i -g whackage

# rest of the steps happen in your project root directory
cd ~/your-project-directory

# create new whackage.json
whack init

# create a link to a package you want to make changes to
whack link ../path/to/other/package

# start react native packager and the whackage server (equivalent to npm start)
whack run start
```

More detailed instructions of each step below:

#### Prerequisites
* node `>=4`
* npm `>=3`
* OSX/Linux. Windows currently not supported, but PRs welcome.
* `rsync` (most likely pre-installed on your system)

#### Install

Install `whackage` globally: 
```sh
npm i -g whackage
```

#### Initialize whackage in your project
You'll now have access to the `whack` command on your command line. To get started, generate an empty
`whackage.json` in your project's root directory:
```sh
whack init
```

#### Link modules

You can then link local copies of React Native libraries to your project with `whack link <path>`, e.g.:
```
whack link ../victory-core-native
whack link ../victory-chart-native
```

You'll now have a `whackage.json` file that looks as follows:
```json
{
  "include": "/**/*.js",
  "exclude": ["/node_modules/*", ".babelrc", ".git"],
  "dependencies": {
    "victory-chart-native": "../victory-chart-native",
    "victory-core-native": "../victory-core-native"
  }
}
```

The `dependencies` map specifies which modules to synchronize, and paths to directories where to
look for the sources.

By default whackage watches changes to `.js` files, and ignores your sources' `node_modules` and git metadata. We also skip copying Babel configurations, because the React Native packager does not support per-module configurations, and project-specific presets [often causes the Babel transpilation step to fail](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10882).

You can configure the `include` and `exclude` glob patterns as needed.

#### Start packager

Start the packager server with `whack run <command>`, where `command` is the npm script you normally use
to start your development server.

If you usually start the server with `npm start`, the corresponding `whackage` command is:
```sh
whack run start
```

(Alternatively, if your start task is `npm run server:dev`, you'd use `whack run server:dev`!)

When started, the `whackage` server will overwrite the specified `dependencies` in your `node_modules`
with the sources you linked with `whack link`, and start a file watcher that synchronizes changes made
in the source directories into your `node_modules` as they happen.

It will also specify a [CLI config](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packager/rn-cli.config.js)
which adds the `node_modules` within linked source directories to the Haste blacklist to avoid `@providesModules`
naming collisions.

#### Update transitive dependencies

When you `whack link` a package, whackage automatically installs and flattens transitive dependencies into your project. If you change the dependencies of your linked packages, you'll need to run `whack install` to add them to your project:
```sh
whack install victory-chart-native
```

Or sync all transitive depedencies or all linked packages:
```sh
whack install
```

#### Stop whacking

When you're done making changes to your local packages, you can remove the `whackage.json` entry and reset the module to its original state:
```
whack unlink victory-chart-native
```

To reset your your original dependencies, but keep the `whackage.json` around for the next time you want to work with that package, simply nuke your `node_modules`:
```
rm -rf node_modules && npm i
```

#### API

Run `whack --help` for a list of all available commands and options.

### Misc

#### Why the name?

It's wacky, it's hacky, and it rhymes with package. Also it whacks your `node_modules`.

#### Contributing

#### Please note

This project is in a pre-release state. The API may be considered relatively stable, but changes may still occur.
